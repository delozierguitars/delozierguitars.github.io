# About Me...

I’m Chris DeLozier, a Cleveland-based luthier with a passion for crafting and restoring guitars. As a Cleveland native, music and craftsmanship have been a central part of my life for years. I specialize in guitar repairs and custom boutique acoustic builds, ensuring each instrument I touch plays and sounds its best.

I honed my skills at Galloup Guitars in Big Rapids, Michigan, where I completed their prestigious Masters Program under Brian Galloup — one of the industry’s leading luthiers. Whether it’s bringing a well-loved instrument back to life or creating a one-of-a-kind custom build, my focus is always on quality, precision, and tone.

If your guitar needs expert care, or you're dreaming of a handcrafted acoustic built just for you, let’s talk.
